# Pade approximation of e^z for Laplace Inversion
Calculate the Zeros and Residues of the Pade approximation of e^z.
See Vlach,Singhal Computer methods for Circuit Analysis  Chapter 10 Numerical Laplace Transform Inversion

"Real time functions can be evaluated using only the poles zi in the upper half plane.
  This reduces the computations to one-half.
  M'=M/2 and Ki'=2*Ki"
  (M = order of denominator, N=order of numerator)
  Select N=M-2
